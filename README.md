<h1>How to build event-driven serverless image application</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I will demonstrate the creation of an event-driven serverless image processing pipeline using S3 event notifications and Lambda. The pipeline involves two S3 buckets â€“ a source bucket and a processed bucket. When new images are added to the source bucket, a Lambda function is triggered by the PUT event. This Lambda function processes the event, extracting crucial details such as bucket and object information. Subsequently, utilizing the PIL (Python Imaging Library, known as Pillow) module, the Lambda function pixelates the image in five different variations (8x8, 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 64x64) before uploading them to the processed bucket.
